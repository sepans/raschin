Strawture
Form is the essential building block of design. From it trickles sensation, reaction, emotion and language and from language flows narrative and symbol, which then flood into identity, society, the political, commercial and environmental world. Martin Venezky, from course description

These are form studies for the form studio course. In this course an object was randomly assigned to each student for form explorations. Mine was straw.
