Wikistalker
 

Wikistalker, inspired by [‘Web Stalker‘](http://www.visualcomplexity.com/vc/project_details.cfm?index=7&id=7&domain), is a way of understanding a concept by only seeing the visualization of the meta-structure of its Wikipedia article. In this visualization, a ‘sun’ is generated for each article. Each ray represents an out-going link. The length of each link shows the semantic relevance between those two linked articles based on ‘Wikipedia Miner‘ measures. Live Demo.

This project is implemented in HTML5 using processingjs and raphaeljs. You can filter links by their relatedness using the sliding bar and sort them alphabetically or by relevance.
