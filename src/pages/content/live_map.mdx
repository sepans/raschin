During my internship in Luidia, I created some experiments using eBeam technology. In Live Map I tried to create a map based on live feed videos. I made three maps of the same spot and then over lap them on top of each other. Here is the result:

I projected tiles of live streams on the wall and draw the map on top of that with eBeam.

These are some other projects that I did in collaboration with other interns.
